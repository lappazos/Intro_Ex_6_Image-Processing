=  Description:  =
==================
first of all, the exercise was very challenging, and cool to go through all of
its stages.

in test46 & test_big46 i received an angle of 136, not 46 - i read in the
forum its ok, hope it is indeed the case - it happend because also 136 is
actually a very strong angle in these images.

i put an extra effort in my efficiency this time, and i would like your feedback
 on my running time. especially in functions - Otsu, apply filter, get_angle
 (current_rank).

 also, i used recursion in my downsample func - hope i used it correctly, and
 again, i would like to get your feedback on that as well please.

i think it would be cool to  the exercise to apply different filters on the
images - it would give us a better look on the power and beauty of what were
doing.
also, a short brief in one of the tirguls on image file types and their
differences might  be super interesting.
